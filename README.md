# Uncommon Floating-Point Precision Issue in Julia

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to floating-point precision in Julia.  The `myfunction` in `bug.jl` appears to handle positive, zero, and negative inputs correctly, but might exhibit unexpected behavior due to precision limitations when comparing floating-point numbers.

The solution (`bugSolution.jl`) offers a strategy to mitigate these issues.  The example highlights the importance of being mindful of floating-point precision, especially when performing comparisons.
